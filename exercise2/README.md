# caseTrack: A pandemic cases visualizer

Version 0.1.0.

This is the skeleton of a C++ program that processes data related to a global pandemic.
It does not visualize anything yet, you will be building up on it in the next worksheets,
and you can be creative! Follow the instructions in the worksheet for what to do now.

## Building

Build the code from your terminal using:

```shell
g++ -o caseTrack caseTrack.cpp
```

## Running

Run the code by executing `./caseTrack`.

## Example output

No output is shown in the screen: this is something for you to add! ðŸ˜‰

But in the end, you should end up with something like this:

```
Today's maximum of 9953 was recorded in Micronesia
```
